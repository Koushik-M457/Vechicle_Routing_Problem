# Vechicle_Routing_Problem
This project implements a solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem in logistics, where the goal is to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to various locations.

The VRP is a widely studied optimization problem in logistics and transportation, where the aim is to design optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles serving multiple locations. The solution minimizes travel cost, time, or distance while respecting constraints such as vehicle capacity and the number of vehicles.
By leveraging Genetic Algorithms, this project demonstrates how evolutionary strategies can efficiently solve complex combinatorial optimization problems.
