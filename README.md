# Vechicle_Routing_Problem
This project implements a solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem in logistics, where the goal is to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to various locations.
